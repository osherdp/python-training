# Monitor Exercise

## Goals

1. Learning how to use numpy, scipy and matplotlib
2. Learning how to handle csv as DB
3. Using pip to install new packages

## Introduction

You are about to implement a computer monitor.
Your goal is to sample your computer RAM usage, CPU usage, temperature and network usage (up and down).
Your program should recieve as a parameter how much time it should run (in seconds), sampling rate and which of the previous parameters it should sample.
Your samples need to be saved in a csv file.
at the end of the run it should create graphs for each parameter tested:
* Value over time
* Value peaks 
* Create a graph of your own
